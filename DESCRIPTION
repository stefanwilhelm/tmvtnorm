Description: Random number generation for the truncated multivariate normal and Student t distribution. 
  Computes probabilities, quantiles and densities, 
  including one-dimensional and bivariate marginal densities. Computes first and second moments (i.e. mean and covariance matrix) for the double-truncated multinormal case.
